**Pitch Deep Dive Period #1 - Working at Jetro Platforms**

**The Call to Adventure:**
Write here why you started the journey in this period, what drew you in, or what was your personal vision when entering this journey in this period:

I wanted to advance from physical work in a warehouse to a career in high-tech, a significant step for me inspired by my father, a software developer. My goal is to progress from software testing to automation development in collaboration with developers to advance the product I'm testing, to be at the forefront of technology, learn new things about the product, and expand my knowledge.

**The Commitment:**
Write here what is the action or moment you remember as pivotal in this period, or the first thing you did that paved the way for the rest of the period:

The significant moment that paved my way was starting my studies at Sela College in the field of software testing, with a desire to deepen and understand the field thoroughly. As part of the studies and ISTQB certification, I was exposed to many topics, including V-Model and Agile, testing levels, test documents, and testing techniques. This process helped me understand the field thoroughly and professionally.

**The Transformation:**
Write here what were the challenges you experienced in that period that forced you to change, improve, and upgrade your level to adapt and produce better results:

The challenges I experienced included learning new technologies and gaining deep familiarity with products at work at Jetro on terminal servers and virtualization. After work, I would come home each time and learn about different products for managing terminal servers, including running remote applications from the client via RDP. I would learn in depth how the product works behind the scenes, just like a network administrator. For example, I worked with a central management application Admin Console, which is responsible for settings and policies on terminal servers, allows adding applications to the client from which they can be run through RDP, as well as managing printing policies with all the settings available on the print server, including driver types, number of pages, print format. From the user's perspective, the experience was as if the application was running locally after connecting to the server. The field fascinated me; I worked with VMware running tests for the client in different work environments (Windows XP, 7, 8, 10). I had to align with system people in the organization to understand in depth how the system works in terms of Active Directory and Group Policy.

**Crossing the Threshold:**
Write here how you overcame those challenges, what changes were required personally, professionally, operationally to succeed and become better and achieve some desired result:

I would come home after work and learn, for example, what is Active Directory, what is Group Policy, virtualization, how to use VMware vSphere client, what is Jira? There were many topics and technologies that I delved into over the years, and thus I understood better how to test the server side, client, and what happens behind the scenes from a system perspective.

**The Return Home:**
Write here what were the most amazing results you created within this period, what improvement occurred as a result of your work and as a result of the challenges you overcame, how it affected you, the organization, or those around you:

The best results in that period were:
1. Development of an Android client product, enabling running remote applications on mobile devices. This was a significant development, a complete rewrite of the desktop application for the Android operating system in collaboration with the development team we brought in
2. We released a new product version with new features and Android support

These developments led to sales growth: more potential customers purchased the product, the company's revenue increased by about 20%, with support for hundreds of customers - this was a great success.
During my software testing studies, I successfully passed the ISTQB exam and completed the studies with an average grade of 90.

**Pitch Deep Dive Period #2 - Working at Malam Team**

**The Call to Adventure:**
Write here why you started the journey in this period, what drew you in, or what was your personal vision when entering this journey in this period:

At that time, Malam Team acquired Jetro Platforms, the company where I worked. I was part of the Malam Team group, a company that provides support for third-party products, including salespeople. This was a significant upgrade to work in a large and stable company.
My vision, of course, was to be part of a large company, advance in my position, and learn more products beyond Jetro and terminal servers. For example, AgilePoint for business process management, BigFix for distributing software updates on different platforms (servers, workstations) including Linux and Windows, or Workato, a web platform for integration and business automation that allows connecting and synchronizing a wide range of systems including Salesforce.
At that time, I asked the CTO if I could test another product? He said yes, AgilePoint.

**The Commitment:**
Write here what is the action or moment you remember as pivotal in this period, or the first thing you did that paved the way for the rest of the period:

The most significant actions from that period are:
1. Migration of virtual machines from VMware from an old server to a new Hyper-V server using StarWind V2V Converter. I found this tool as a good solution for transferring machines from VMware to Hyper-V with disk conversion from VMDK to vhdx
2. Installation of work environments for different products in Hyper-V. For example, terminal servers for Jetro Platforms products and for AgilePoint, installation of IIS server, installation of SQL server and .NET 4, to later install the product on the server using an exe file. Additionally, I also installed Windows and Linux servers for BigFix and WebFocus
3. Collaboration with the developer in developing a Web Dashboard project in Hebrew for a client, using API calls from Swagger of AgilePoint. The data for the Dashboard is taken from the cloud platform
4. I was part of a testing team in an AgilePoint project for an end client that included procurement and tenders with roles such as: engineering, legal, property, and more. Each time we tested a certain workflow with a different role, transitions between roles. The project helped me better understand the client's business process and of course improved my knowledge of the product itself; I knew how to build business processes with Workflow in AgilePoint.

In this project, I don't know about a significant achievement because I left the company a few days after joining the testing team for a DevOps job at a startup; I don't know how the project ended.

The installation of work environments significantly improved the number of environments for support, presenting the company's different products, for testing, and for reproducing bugs.
All the experience in projects significantly improved my knowledge in the Web field, mainly in manual testing with strong knowledge in Frontend and Backend testing.

**The Transformation:**
Write here what were the challenges you experienced in that period that forced you to change, improve, and upgrade your level to adapt and produce better results:

The challenges I experienced were:
1. I learned a new product while working, after work hours through videos. When something wasn't clear, I asked questions, experimented through hands-on, and used technical documents from the AgilePoint website
2. I mainly learned how to transfer virtual machines from VMware to Hyper-V using a free tool I found online (StarWind V2V Converter)
3. In the project, I mainly learned what Postman is, what an API call is, and how to work with it in depth using Postman, including POST and GET operations. I used Swagger which provides comprehensive documentation for all API calls in the system to advance the project together with the developer
4. I was required to understand the client's complex business system according to test scenarios in Azure Test Plans. Each time I tested a workflow with one or more roles, verified that transitions between roles were correct, including form field data, mandatory fields, and that information was properly saved during transitions.

**Crossing the Threshold:**
Write here how you overcame those challenges, what changes were required personally, professionally, operationally to succeed and become better and achieve some desired result:

1. I learned the product through hands-on and videos, saw examples of business processes created in the system, like adding a new employee, integration with other systems focusing on SharePoint and some Salesforce. I also installed a SharePoint server for testing, got into the product as much as possible including AgilePoint installation. As a result, I had more control and understanding of the system, mainly in Backend and also in Frontend testing
2. I learned how to transfer virtual machines from VMware to Hyper-V using a free tool I found online. This improved my experience mainly in Hyper-V; I better understood how to create virtual machines, import them to advance support, testing, and bug reproduction
3. I had to learn a lot about the system, mainly API calls and Postman, to advance the project together with the developer up to presentation to the client
4. I understood a complex business system and multi-role testing according to test scenarios in Azure Test Plans. The challenge is: testing multi-status and multi-role workflow processes, including form field data, mandatory fields, and that information is properly saved during transitions.

**The Return Home:**
Write here what were the most amazing results you created within this period, what improvement occurred as a result of your work and as a result of the challenges you overcame, how it affected you, the organization, or those around you:

The most amazing results in the period are:
1. Migration of virtual machines from VMware server to Hyper-V. I significantly improved the number of environments, which greatly helped employees in daily work supporting customers.
I improved my knowledge mainly in how to transfer virtual machines, how to add machines in Hyper-V, how to import them
2. The installation of work environments for Jetro and AgilePoint greatly helped support in reproducing bugs, presenting the product to clients, and testing company products.
I improved support and testing efficiency by 30%, which enabled easier bug reproduction and testing
3. I collaborated with the developer in developing a Web Dashboard project in Hebrew for a client, using API calls through Swagger of AgilePoint. I mainly improved my knowledge in REST API with Postman and Swagger; this helped me map which API belongs to which area in the AgilePoint platform to get the appropriate data from JSON file for the Dashboard.
Using Swagger helped me reduce work time by 40%, identify the appropriate API, and provide quick response to the developer who integrated the API into the dashboard until presenting the project to the client.

**Pitch Deep Dive Period #3 - Working at RRsystems**

**The Call to Adventure:**
Write here why you started the journey in this period, what drew you in, or what was your personal vision when entering this journey in this period:

I started my journey at the company with expectations to advance from manual testing to automation. The CEO supported and emphasized that there is a need for automation for the medical product for managing medical centers. I understood that testing is mainly manual and in my free time I would advance automation.
The vision was mainly to advance automation or test manually according to the position and need at work.

**The Commitment:**
Write here what is the action or moment you remember as pivotal in this period, or the first thing you did that paved the way for the rest of the period:

The most significant moment in the period was updating the IIS website for testing; I ran publish in Visual Studio from the Dev branch in Azure DevOps, pulled development changes using the git pull command to update IIS in the testing environment (On-premises).
I improved maintenance and availability of test environments; this enabled development to quickly address bugs we found in the testing team and bugs found by customers.

**The Transformation:**
Write here what were the challenges you experienced in that period that forced you to change, improve, and upgrade your level to adapt and produce better results:

At that time, challenges included learning a new web product for managing medical centers with many options, for example: patient file, appointment scheduling in calendar, uploading and generating medical documents, creating treatment packages, displaying information in reports, and communication with an external system (SAP) for transferring treatment payments to credit companies, including support for mobile browser view. The scope of testing was enormous; each time we were required to add tests to scenarios that were initially managed in Excel. There was chaos around the testing process and code complexity on the development side; it was challenging to improve product quality together with a support employee who helped with testing.
The development manager decided at the beginning of each sprint to allocate about two work days for Sanity test testing with an update of the checklist for each sprint with date and iteration number, so there would be more order in testing. If we didn't finish testing everything, then part of the development team helped with testing.
In the remaining days, we progressed on tasks in Azure DevOps; we focused mainly on testing new developments with short test scenarios for each development so it would be clear what was being tested. Almost daily there was a Daily meeting with the development manager for progress updates. Every bug we found, we updated the developers about it, and then verified that the fix actually solved the problem.

**Crossing the Threshold:**
Write here how you overcame those challenges, what changes were required personally, professionally, operationally to succeed and become better and achieve some desired result:

I recommended to the development manager to transfer test scenarios from Excel to Azure Test Plans to streamline testing and have more order in testing; she of course approved this, and within a short time of about an hour I uploaded the tests to the cloud. Each Sanity can be linked to a sprint, including reporting bugs with screenshots, assignment to a developer - very convenient to track. 

**The Return Home:**
Write here what were the most amazing results you created within this period, what improvement occurred as a result of your work and as a result of the challenges you overcame, how it affected you, the organization, or those around you:

The best result in the period was updating the IIS website for testing, from running publish in Visual Studio in Azure DevOps. A talented developer in the company thought of this as a good solution for updating development changes in the testing environment without being dependent on the CTO's update about once a week, which could delay testing. As a result, I improved maintenance and availability of test environments by about 20%, enabling development to quickly address bugs we found in the testing team and bugs found by customers.

**Pitch Deep Dive Period #4 - Automation Course at Atid Automation College**

**The Call to Adventure:**
Write here why you started the journey in this period, what drew you in, or what was your personal vision when entering this journey in this period:

I started the journey because I decided it was essential to advance automation, essential to know how to write a complete automation framework for multiple operating systems including Web, mobile, desktop, DB testing, and API. I'm already a software tester with 10 years of experience; the time has come to advance in this field properly and later also integrate automation with AI, for example: automation in Claude with MCP server or running tests through Testrigor and n8n; from time to time I'm exposed to new automation tools on LinkedIn from posts and jobs.

**The Commitment:**
Write here what is the action or moment you remember as pivotal in this period, or the first thing you did that paved the way for the rest of the period:

The moment that paved the way is of course the awareness that I have knowledge gaps in programming in automation, and to really advance this, I need to turn to experts who understand this field properly. I decided to approach Atid Automation to learn their online Full Stack Test Automation course with Python. The course helped me a lot mainly in building a good framework with Allure Report, UI testing using Applitools, and running tests using Jenkins; I uploaded it to GitHub.

**The Transformation:**
Write here what were the challenges you experienced in that period that forced you to change, improve, and upgrade your level to adapt and produce better results:

During the course, I encountered several challenges:
1. Code that didn't work and I used support. For example, the API automation didn't work according to what the instructor explained in the video, so I had to search Grafana's documentation to understand the problem. Videos of course are not always updated, so it's worth reading the documentation or getting help from ChatGPT regarding a specific difficulty or problem and move forward from there with judgment
2. There was also a problem in Jenkins; after installing the Allure Report plugin, I didn't see a certain option in the system. It turned out that the installed Java version was not up-to-date, so Jenkins didn't display the report option. I also encountered challenges with Selenium 4 where not everything is supported in this version, for example mobile automation and Applitools didn't work properly in this version. I had to update Selenium to version 3 so everything would work in automation
3. There were also difficulties with venv in PyCharm; not all libraries were installed properly. There was a bit of chaos with versions in the Requirements document (like the version of appium-client and Applitools); in the end I solved it. I used ChatGPT a bit from what I remember

**Crossing the Threshold:**
Write here how you overcame those challenges, what changes were required personally, professionally, operationally to succeed and become better and achieve some desired result:

I used ChatGPT to overcome difficulties with compatibility issues between versions in Requirements and in writing the README in the project Repository - I used it a lot.
I also used support for a problem in Jenkins where I didn't see certain options and didn't understand what the problem was; in the end it turned out that the Java version was not up-to-date.
Changes in thinking and judgment were required when using AI, for example in the README I used AI and then changed the content to what's best to present in the project. If I'm really stuck, then I need to send an email to support or ask for help from the mentor who will give a hint or direct me to a different direction of thinking that I hadn't thought of.

**The Return Home:**
Write here what were the most amazing results you created within this period, what improvement occurred as a result of your work and as a result of the challenges you overcame, how it affected you, the organization, or those around you:

After I finished learning the online course from Atid Automation, I managed to build a quality automation framework in Selenium that can serve as a template for projects in studies, at work, and in the project. I'm able to develop automation for most operating systems and deal with programming challenges. I gained a complete understanding in building automation framework for multiple operating systems, including reports and running automation in Jenkins. This opened up additional possibilities for me, such as integrating GitHub Actions and Docker in automation.
My knowledge has upgraded and today I can set up automation framework 40% faster in Python, Java, JavaScript, and C# languages, while choosing the appropriate framework for each language.

**Pitch Deep Dive Period #5 - Project**

**The Call to Adventure:**
Write here why you started the journey in this period, what drew you in, or what was your personal vision when entering this journey in this period:

I started the journey in this period because I wanted to advance automation even more, beyond the Atid Automation course with GitHub Actions and Docker in the MVP stage of the project, to have something to show in job interviews that I know automation properly with focus on Selenium.

I started the journey with the goal of gaining experience in automation beyond the course.

**The Commitment:**
Write here what is the action or moment you remember as pivotal in this period, or the first thing you did that paved the way for the rest of the period:

The first thing that paved the way was writing test cases in Azure Test Plans end-to-end; at first I wrote the Sanity test (the main flow) with the following features, then I wrote more complex test scenarios to do validation on the financial website that allows building a financial plan, including tracking a personal financial plan, seeing others' plans, and alerts for checking action implementation:
1. Login page
2. System registration page
3. Forgot password
4. OTP verification
5. Shell
6. Financial plan building process
7. Purchase proposal page
8. Checkout page
9. Actions summary page
10. User profile page

Writing test scenarios can help me a lot later; in the MVP stage I'll translate the main flow to automation with Selenium Java; there will also be GitHub Actions and Docker after the automation for the main flow is ready.

**The Transformation:**
Write here what were the challenges you experienced in that period that forced you to change, improve, and upgrade your level to adapt and produce better results:

At first, I dealt with a challenge in setting up the framework in Maven; I didn't remember exactly what needs to be in the pom.xml file to configure the project dependencies, for example Selenium and Allure Report that didn't work for me. I used a Udemy course and ChatGPT to overcome the difficulties.
After the automation was running, I gradually added more classes to build a good automation framework that would enable quick progress in translating test scenarios. For example: BasePage class responsible for browser initialization, page manager initialization (Page Object Model - POM), and a class for performing actions on elements (locators) such as clicking, typing text, etc.
Another challenge was testing how to access the email account in Java to extract the OTP code and then use it to log into the system.
What I still don't know how to do is run the automation using GitHub Actions. After I upload the code to GitHub, I'll check this with ChatGPT's help, and at the end I'll also add Docker after there's Allure Report in GitHub Actions.
The high demands in the job market forced me to change. Today they expect QA automation to master CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, to write a complete pipeline, including deploying the product to the cloud, to know AI tools, and even Kubernetes. To reach challenging topics like Kubernetes, I first need to find an entry-level automation position (up to two, three years of experience), from there accumulate knowledge through hands-on until achieving the required knowledge and experience.

**Crossing the Threshold:**
Write here how you overcame those challenges, what changes were required personally, professionally, operationally to succeed and become better and achieve some desired result:

I used ChatGPT in writing code for extracting the password from the OTP email; the AI found a solution using IMAP and adding app security with a 16-character password that allows connecting to the account. This solution works well with quite complex recursion code, ensuring that the content in the HTML page in the OTP email is translated to text, and then the password needs to be extracted from the text, which is no longer a problem. This was a quite complex part that I eventually understood.
I overcame the challenges through understanding the problem, until finding a solution and implementing it with AI help that directs to the solution; I verified it actually works and then changed it according to what's needed to progress in running test scenarios.
The changes required personally are to get help from automation field experts to understand how to build a good framework, then progress with ChatGPT or another artificial intelligence tool; when it comes to something complex, for example accessing an external system API or translating code from Python to Java, in cases where I don't know something or don't remember, I use AI.

**The Return Home:**
Write here what were the most amazing results you created within this period, what improvement occurred as a result of your work and as a result of the challenges you overcame, how it affected you, the organization, or those around you:

A notable achievement for me was writing end-to-end Sanity tests in Azure Test Plans. These scenarios served as a basis for more advanced tests, including validation and negative testing (trying to break the system). They helped me reduce by about 50% the time for writing advanced scenarios by copying existing scenarios with changes as needed.
Additionally, I wrote an automation framework from scratch and uploaded it to GitHub Actions with a table displaying test run results (passed/failed) and a test report that can be downloaded; as a result, I reduced production deployment time and customer delivery by 40% through combining automation and manual testing, improving customer satisfaction.
