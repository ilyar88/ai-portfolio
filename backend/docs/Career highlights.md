**Period #1 - Software Engineering:**

**General Details - Including Dates:**
Software Engineering 2008 - 2010
Final project completed in 2011

**Why I Started and First Steps:**
At the National Insurance Institute, I was initially eligible for funding for one technology course without payment. I started studying at Afeka when I was 20. During studies, we learned programming languages: Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, C, and HTML. Additionally, there was assembler, information systems analysis, detailed OS study including communications and networks, introduction to multimedia and internet, SQL, and Linux. My grades were overall good, averaging above 85.

**Challenges Experienced:**
The main difficulty was the final project, whose requirements were higher than the studies themselves. I could choose a project like: game vs computer, network game, file management, trivia games, etc. I chose a card game project over the network based on family recommendations. During the project, knowledge gaps emerged that I struggled to complete. For example, I didn't know how to make the game work on a network; I used Google, videos, and family help to progress. When the project was ready between two network participants, I was called for an exam and received a grade of 80 from what I remember. Each time I went over the code I wrote with family help, and thanks to that I passed the exam.

**Ways of Coping:**
I tried to do most of the project alone in C#, relied heavily on Google but didn't always find suitable code. Family saw I had knowledge gaps and helped me so the code would be impressive in the exam. Thanks to their help, I passed. The game logic worked; only the server communication was missing.

**Results and Achievements:**
The result was that the card game finally worked when two players played over the network. Despite it working, I decided to improve it further, raise code quality, and succeeded. There was small improvement in the algorithm, in card dragging on the board from what I remember.

**Period #2 - Working at Jetro Platforms:**

**General Details:**
Worked at Jetro Platforms from 2013 to 2016
Role: Software Tester

**Why I Started:**
I wanted to start working in high-tech to advance in the field. It was a bit difficult to leave temporary physical work for a year in Be'er Ya'akov and start working with computers; within a short time I got used to it. Initially worked with VMware then with Jira to streamline testing and open bugs in an organized manner. The product enables running applications from terminal servers via RDP. The client sees the application as if it's running locally on the computer.

Company products:
1. Admin Console - enables managing settings and policies on terminal servers via central server, includes user management via Active Directory access and Load Balancing to distribute loads between servers
2. Application Delivery - policy part of admin console, responsible for desktop product client settings, e.g., desktop login without username/password (Auto login) or Two-factor authentication
3. Secure Browsing - policy allowing browser settings configuration in Chrome or Explorer running from terminal

**Challenges:**
Main challenges were learning new things in virtualization: understanding VMware, virtual machines, RDP, terminal server, print server. Initially tested company products manually; my father wanted automation too. I wrote some C# automation in Visual Studio for Code UI but didn't have time. I was the only tester with a product manager who wanted manual testing.

**Coping Methods:**
I remember reading about virtualization, VMware, including terminal server, thin client. Didn't dive deep then; focused heavily on manual software testing, dealing with test cases, Sanity, bug reporting in Jira. Learned Selenium automation at home in Java, also improved my software engineering project to review programming.

**Results:**
When I started working at Malam in Jetro development, they released a new version for company products - very successful with many customers using the product. My testing and bug reporting helped improve product quality. There was also an Android OS rewrite project. I tested the Android app extensively during early development stages, including Sanity testing and bug reporting in Jira. This mobile app project was also successful - more options and sales in the company, more revenue and support for hundreds of users.

These developments led to sales growth: more potential customers purchased the product, company revenue increased by about 20% with support for hundreds of customers - a great success.

**Period #3 - Software Testing Course:**

**Details:**
Studied software testing course from 2014 to 2015 at Sela College

**Why I Started:**
Wanted to know the testing field properly; Sela College was relatively close to work. Studies focused mainly on ISTQB certification. Learned testing methodologies and document writing. Tested e-commerce store project, wrote STP and STR including test cases according to requirements in MTM with TFS. Additionally learned SQL and C#, wrote Tetris game as programming project in studies.

**Challenges:**
Challenges were combining work with studies; managed to pass ISTQB exam at completion with good grades in all areas.

**Coping:**
Each time I arrived at studies in Ramat Gan by bike from Petach Tikva, always invested and grades were high. Did homework, reviewed material, practiced ISTQB topics, SQL, programming. Studied after work on course topics, asked questions if something wasn't clear.

**Results:**
Passed ISTQB exam and successfully completed studies with 90 average.

**Period #4 - Working at Malam Team:**

**Details:**
Work at Malam Team from 2015 to 2022
Role: Software Tester / Systems

**Why I Started:**
Entire team moved to Malam Team to company called Team Software, part of Malam. Significant improvement to work in large company. At beginning of work at Malam, 75% position bothered me; asked to increase to full-time and they did. Very connected to Sysadmin field: dealing with server installations, settings, GPO, IIS installation, DHCP, VPN, even learned about ADFS.

Worked with AgilePoint for about 4 years - business process management product in cloud, including dragging web components like text, buttons, dropdowns, and creating business processes. Has good integration with several products focusing on SharePoint with Azure, Salesforce, etc.

**Major Projects:**
1. First AgilePoint project: Building Hebrew web dashboard with developer
2. Second project: Testing business process for Mekorot client - very complex process
3. Third project: Migrating virtual machines from VMware from old server to new server with Hyper-V

Set up many virtual work environments for various company products mainly providing customer support with salespeople for third-party products.

**Challenges:**
Had to learn new AgilePoint product initially from website videos, then started diving in including API testing, building small processes. Many challenges along the way to progress in required work knowledge. Challenges included learning AgilePoint product unknown before, API testing via Postman and Swagger.

**Results:**
Results were good - had virtual environments for products like AgilePoint, Jetro, BigFix, WebFocus. Greatly helped company reproduce customer bugs, helped me in testing. Additionally built workstations for employees - was kind of systems in addition to testing. Configured about 500 virtual machines while working at Malam.

Significantly improved support and testing environments quantity - improved support and testing efficiency by 30%, enabling easier bug reproduction and testing.
