**What would people tell me about you if I asked at your previous workplace?**
I am professional, love to develop and learn new things, committed to goals, overcome problems in various ways, and consult with the team when necessary.

**Why do you deserve this salary?**
Because I am an expert tester with several years of experience, know systems and automation with experience in Postman, SQL, Selenium, and Jira, with expertise in leading end-to-end testing for fintech systems in Web and Mobile to improve reliability and user experience in data-intensive products.

**I see you're currently working at a company / personal project, why are you looking for a new position?**
I'm currently working on a temporary project of several months; upon completion, I want to start the next challenge.

**What are you looking for?**
I'm looking for an automation position in Selenium with up to two, three years of experience.

**When can you start working?**
I can start working two weeks in advance; the project's phase at the company is in final stages.

**Do you have other processes underway?**
*Hint - let's build a good answer that will always serve us and impress potential employers on one hand, but not too much in terms of closing processes.

Yes, there are other processes underway, but I really connected with your product and company, so I would be happy to join you according to requirements and conditions.

**What attracts you to positions in your field?**
*Hint for senior positions - use why you've stayed in this field for so many years, what keeps the fire burning?
*Hint for entry-level positions - this cannot be a generic answer like "looking to develop and learn." Everyone says that and it doesn't differentiate you. You need to focus on the value you'll bring to the employer, the results and benefits you have both personally and professionally over the 20 candidates before you and the 20 candidates after you.

What attracts me to the field is of course improving product quality end-to-end, through writing automation frameworks or maintaining existing frameworks with adding tests. This can reduce test execution time by about 40% or more, which is a significant achievement.

**What motivates you at work or in the professional pursuit you chose?**
What motivates me is of course improving product quality, increasing customer satisfaction alongside leading end-to-end testing and being a significant component to the team and organization.

**What was your responsibility in the last position/project:**
The responsibility was leading testing for an end-to-end financial web project, writing test scripts, running them through automation, and reporting bugs. There I reduced production deployment time and delivery to customers by 40%.

**(Relevant for tech people) What technologies did you use recently / (Relevant for non-tech professions) What professional aspects have you dealt with recently?**
I used the following technologies:
1. Azure Test Plans - for writing test scripts and reporting bugs
2. Maven - for writing automation framework in Selenium Java with Allure report
3. GitHub Actions - to run automation in CI/CD tool including attaching Allure report and displaying test results in a table
4. Docker - using containers in GitHub Actions to run tests

I recently dealt with automation development and AI, through learning from Udemy courses alongside practical experience in a real project at a software house: writing test scripts, running them end-to-end, and subsequently translating them to automation and reporting bugs.

**(If relevant) What did you do during the time you were without a position?**
I mainly improved my automation capabilities in writing a good framework, studied a Full Stack Automation course at Atid Automation with multiple operating systems (web, mobile, and desktop). The course helped me significantly improve framework building; I can now build a framework from a template 40% faster in different programming languages.

**How would you describe your ability in your field?**
Expert software tester in end-to-end automation, can write frameworks for multiple operating systems (web, mobile, desktop), including results reporting (passed/failed) and full test details. Including support and accessibility to other stakeholders in the project.

**What is the negative criticism I usually receive?**
I have a tendency toward perfectionism in testing; sometimes I test beyond what's defined in test documents when bugs are fixed or new features are developed, with the goal of improving product quality. Today I align expectations on scope with my supervisor through a checklist, and if additional depth is required, I open a separate task for the next sprint.

**What is your greatest weakness?**
Difficulty prioritizing tasks; today I consult with the team leader on priorities and act accordingly.

**Do you have any regrets about things you've done in the past?**
Yes. During my work at Malam Team, I tried to advance to a more challenging DevOps field, to combine more automation with development; it was a significant leap for me in my career. During the work, I identified knowledge gaps in the field because I came from the testing world, so I understood that I wanted to return to testing but simultaneously improve my capabilities both as a manual and automation software tester and also my development capabilities in the DevOps worlds.

**Are you willing to fail?**
Yes. I see failure as part of the learning process, analyze mistakes, draw conclusions, and improve performance to succeed in the role and company.

**If you could relive the last few years, what would you do differently?**
I would have stayed at Malam Team, waited for an opportunity more suitable to my knowledge and experience, such as: an automation position or software testing position with more systems where there would be room to advance in terms of knowledge and career.

**Do you have luck?**
Yes. I believe luck is the ability to find the right workplace according to knowledge and experience; I think I found the place where it's possible to advance end-to-end automation.

**Mention a lesson you learned and improved following a mistake you made?**
In my previous job, I built an automation framework not exactly according to what's standard with division into pages; there were some inaccuracies. I understood that to really advance automation, I needed to turn to experts, studied a Full Stack Automation course at Atid Automation and improved my capabilities. Today my testing capabilities are very strong with building frameworks from scratch, uploading to cloud (GitHub Actions), reducing production deployment time and customer delivery.

**If you had superpowers, what would they be?**
Bug prediction superpower: to identify problems before they happen, adapt tests (manual/automation) to prevent severe bugs from reaching test or production environments.

**What is your plan for the next 5 years?**
To be a DevOps developer working in collaboration with the company team, including building and maintaining end-to-end development processes (CI/CD).

**What factor, besides money, gives you the most satisfaction in the workplace?**
Teamwork of course would give satisfaction at work with product advancement.

**Tell about a situation where you overcame a significant professional obstacle?**
I managed to run an automated process in the cloud (GitHub Actions) for a financial web product. It was very challenging; in the end I succeeded in transferring the code from the computer to the cloud.
I dealt with new technology; during the experience I encountered various difficulties. For example, I was required to change the code so the browser would run in headless mode (without graphical display) to adapt the automation to the technology so the run would be faster. Then I added a table displaying run results (passed/failed) and a test report that can be downloaded.

**How do you deal with stress and pressure?**
I'm usually calm under pressure, prioritize tasks, seek help with testing when needed to maintain quality and pace.

**Are you willing to jump into the fire for me? Give me an example that you did this for a previous employer?**
Yes. I'm ready to advance in the role, jump into dealing with complex things at the company like: writing code or improving existing automation framework.
I added to the framework another cloud run (GitHub Actions) with a table displaying run results (passed/failed) and a test report that can be downloaded. I progressed on this beyond work hours so the employer would be satisfied. As a result, I reduced production deployment time and customer delivery by 40% through combining automation and manual testing, improved customer satisfaction.

**Why should we hire you?**
*Hint for people starting out - without generic answers like "I'm full of motivation and desire and passion to prove myself." Everyone writes this and it doesn't work and isn't authoritative - compose a complete answer that includes your differentiation. 🔥

I am diligent and organized, with extensive automation experience, bringing significant value in advancing and improving product quality in the organization.
At the last company where I worked (TechTopia), I wrote an automation framework from scratch for a financial website with cloud upload (GitHub Actions), including a table displaying run results (passed/failed) and a test report that can be downloaded. As a result, I reduced production deployment time and customer delivery by 40% through combining automation and manual testing, improved customer satisfaction.

**Why should we not hire you?**
I am a software tester with knowledge and extensive experience in automation and manual testing. I set up an automation framework from scratch for a finance website at the company (TechTopia). If you think I'm not suitable for the position, it's a shame; I can advance testing and reduce production deployment times.

**Tell me about yourself?**
I am a software tester with several years of experience in testing with emphasis on server and client side, know automation. Expert in leading end-to-end testing for a financial system. I play chess; it helps me plan several steps ahead in terms of testing and thinking outside the box.

**What is your greatest achievement?**
I led end-to-end testing at Jetro Platforms for a product that enables running remote applications from the server in a desktop application. As a result, product quality improved; we released a new version with hundreds of satisfied customers and a 20% improvement in sales.

**What can you offer that other candidates cannot?**
Leading end-to-end testing in automation on various platforms such as: Web, mobile, and desktop, including test report generation (passed/failed). Can run performance testing in automation, bringing broad and practical knowledge compared to other candidates in the field.
I can reduce production deployment time by 40% through cloud automation processes (GitHub Actions) and through additional technologies like: Jenkins for financial websites and additional sites.

**Has anyone who supervises you ever doubted your ability/decision and how did you deal with it?**
Yes. At the company in Rehovot, RRsystems, the tests were initially written in Excel. I told the development manager to move to a dedicated testing tool with more organized bug tracking; I recommended Azure Test Plans in the cloud. She of course wasn't familiar with it and was skeptical. In the end, she decided it was worth trying to see if it would improve order and testing tracking. Initially there was about a 10% improvement in order and tracking, until they got used to working with Test Plans.
The handling was that I explained to her that it's not proper to write tests in Excel, it's not convenient to track when there are developments from several iterations. Each time you have to go through the document, see the status of bugs there, whether it was fixed or not. Software testers work with testing management tools, not with Excel.

**Who was your favorite supervisor and who was the least favorite and why?**
The most favorite supervisor was the product manager at Jetro Platforms; she was always strict in the role that you need to test as much as possible, everything should be organized in test scripts, bugs should be clear with screenshots in the bug management tool, so it would be possible to track. Each time we would drive to work from Modi'in; she was very skilled in product management. She received an outstanding employee award for teamwork when we released a new product version with Android operating system support.
I connected less with the development manager at the company in Rehovot at RRsystems; most of the work was manual testing and little automation; I connected less with that. I understood that currently there's no real need for automation because of the product's complexity.

**What did you like and not like in the previous position / personal project and why?**
In the project, I didn't like the dependency on the supplier responsible for sending the password to email; this dependency delayed the progress of manual testing. Therefore, I advanced automation in parallel to manual testing until the problem would be handled.

**What is the most satisfying thing in your previous position / personal project?**
The most satisfying thing in the project is writing automation; it's a significant experience in the field. Most of the time I dealt with manual testing with emphasis on server and client side, a little in automation over the years. This experience can bring significant value to the company.

**(If relevant) Why do you have a gap in your employment sequence?**
*Hint - anyone with a significant gap in employment sequence is welcome to consult with the team to create an authoritative answer to this question. Anyone who indeed has a significant gap will be required to answer sharply and matter-of-factly here.

I decided the time had come to advance automation properly, to learn from the experts. I studied Full Stack Automation at Atid Automation College and then gained practical experience in the project. Today there's also rapid advancement of AI that can push out manual testing, so it's essential to know automation properly.

**Describe one thing you would change in your previous job / personal project?**
I would add improvements to the automation framework I wrote at work in Rehovot (RRsystems), such as more correct division into classes, pages in code. A class for performing actions on elements (locators) such as clicking, typing text, etc., so there would be separation between all different roles.
Then I would upload the code to cloud (GitHub Actions) so it would be at the same level of professionalism as the framework I built in the project.

**What do you expect from your supervisor?**
I expect a framework in a team that enables generating quick impact to advance automation, including end-to-end automated processes like CI/CD with clear goals, stable testing environments, close collaboration with development/DevOps, regular maintenance time for stability during the sprint. I commit to advancing automation, updating existing tests, reducing regression and maintenance times with significant improvement in timelines.

**How would you deal with a situation of disagreement within the team?**
I would listen to all sides, align on goals and criteria, proceed with judgment to decision, go with majority decision or domain leader.

**How would you deal with negative criticism?**
I would listen to everything the supervisor, team leader has to say with drawing conclusions. I would write all the conclusions regarding the negative criticism so it won't happen next time.

**Practice of specific preparation questions?**
As part of preparation for each process, we want to do this part each time we're in a process with an employer and adapt the answers to them. This time we'll practice "dry run" on a random company we might want to work at, for example: Wix, Meta, Monday, Bank Hapoalim, and when we open processes with potential employers, we'll want to fill only this part again in another document as specific preparation for interviews at that place.

**Which company did you choose?** 
Matrix

**Why do you want to work here?**
Because it's a large and stable company with a variety of advancement opportunities for software testers in the automation field; you can later advance to DevOps, development. There are also advancement opportunities with clients, significant projects in development teams.

**What do you know about our company?**
Example: I know it's a large technology company, with branches throughout the country (Herzliya, Kfar Saba, Haifa) and abroad. The company has several divisions: software testing, automation development, and DevOps. Learn about the company before the interview.

**Do you have questions for me?**
Ask questions that can show interest in the role regarding the product, technologies, regarding the team composition.
